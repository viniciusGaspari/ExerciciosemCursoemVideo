Welcome to my repository of exercises from the Curso em Video! This course has been instrumental in helping me improve my JavaScript skills.

In this repository, you will find a collection of exercises that I completed and tested thoroughly in JavaScript. These exercises cover a wide range of topics such as basic syntax, functions, loops, and more.
